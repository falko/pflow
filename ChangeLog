1.0beta2 - [RELEASEDATE]

- Added convenience method ezcConsoleOutput::outputLine(). 
  This one adds a line break after outputting the desired text and works also
  without any text to print a blank line (similar to Pascals writeln()).
- Added option filter parameter to eczConsoleParameter::getHelp().
  This allows you to filter which parameters the information will return
  information about.
- Added a new class ezcConsoleOption. 
  This represents a single option. Before this was named parameter and an array was
  used to structure option properties.
- Added new setting "mandatory" to ezcConsoleOption.
  This indicates that an option should always have submitted. Normally all
  options are optional.
- Added cell, row and table based format and alignment settings to ezcConsoleTable.
  This allows you to let rows and cells inherit their format and alignment
  settings. Rows inherit the format, align and (new) borderFormat
  value that were set globally, but only if they have no explicit value set.
  Cells inherit their row's format and alignment settings if they are not
  explicitly set.
- Added <borderFormat> property to rows.
  This allows a more flexible way to specify the format that a row's border should
  have, instead of just saying "this is a headline row".

- Refactored the whole package to fit into the unified layout and provide a
  much more convenient API.
- Changed to the use of structs instead of complex array structures: 
  * ezcConsoleOptionRule (replaces old handling of dependencies and exclusions
    between options - former parameters).
  * ezcConsoleOutputFormat (to define format options).
  * ezcConsoleOutputOptions (stores the options for ezcConsoleOutput).
  * ezcConsoleProgressbarOptions (stores the options for ezcConsoleProgressbar).
  * eczConsoleTableOptions (stores the options for ezcConsoleTable).

- Changed to the use of "extended structs" where it made sense to avoid
  complex arrays:
  * ezcConsoleOutputFormats (iteration and on-the-fly creation of format
    definitions in ezcConsoleOutput through
	$out->formats->{formatname}->{formatoption} = ...;)

- Changed handling of parameter names in ezcConsoleInput. 
  Short and long parameters are now also handled without their prefixes ("-"
  for short names and "--" for long names) everywhere.
- Changed to use overloading property access - __get(),__set(),__isset().
  To unify access to object properties and in different other places, which
  are explicitly mentioned above (see e.g. ezcConsoleTable) where possible (more 
  convenient API).
- Changed handling of default values for ezcComponentOption.
  Default values are now set, if the parameter is not submitted at all. If an
  option that expects a value is submitted without, this results in an
  exception.
- Changed handling of table structure to classes ezcConsoleTableRow and ezcConsoleTableCell. 
  These allow a new, innovative and very convenient way to create and customize console
  based tables: 
  * $table[0][]; // creates a new cell 
  * $table[2][]->format = 'important'; // creates a new cell and set's it's format to 'important',
  * $table[2]->align = ezcConsoleTable::ALIGN_CENTER; // set's the default align

- Renamed ezcConsoleParameter to ezcConsoleInput.
- Renamed methods:
  * ezcConsoleOutput::styleText() to ezcConsoleOutput::formatText()
  * ezcConsoleInput::fromString() to ezcConsoleInput::registerOptionString()

- Fixed bug with argument handling and non-value parameters in ezcConsoleInput.
  It was not possible to sumit the name of a parameter as an agument after the
  argument seperator "-- ".
- Fixed bug with submitting multiple parameters of the same name without value
