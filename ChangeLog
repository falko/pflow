1.0beta2 - [RELEASEDATE]

- Added convenience method ezcConsoleOutput::outputLine(). 
  This one adds a
  line break after outputting the desired text and works also without any
  text to print a blank line (similar to Pascals writeln()).
- Added option filter parameter to eczConsoleParameter::getHelp().
  This allows you to filter, about which parameters the information will be
  returned.
- Added a new class ezcConsoleOption. 
  This represents a single option (this was named parameter and an array was
  used to structure option properties before).
- Added new setting "mandatory" to ezcConsoleOption.
  This indicates that an  option has to be submitted always (usually all
  options are optional).
- Added cell, row and table based format and alignment settings to ezcConsoleTable.
  This allows you to let rows and cells inherit their format and alignment
  settings. Rows inherit the globally set format, align and (new) borderFormat
  value, if they have no explicit one set. Cell inherit their row's format and
  align settings if not explicitly set.
- Added <borderFormat> property to rows.
  This allows a more flexible way to specify the format a row's border should
  get applied instead of just saying "this is a headline row", as it was
  beofore.

- Refactored the whole package to fit into the unified layout and provide a
  much more convenient API.
- Changed to the use of structs, where it made sense, instead of complex array
  structures: 
  - ezcConsoleOptionRule (replaces old handling of dependencies and exclusions
    between options - former parameters).
  - ezcConsoleOutputFormat (to define format options).
  - ezcConsoleOutputOptions (stores the options for ezcConsoleOutput).
  - ezcConsoleProgressbarOptions (stores the options for ezcConsoleProgressbar).
  - eczConsoleTableOptions (stores the options for ezcConsoleTable).
- Changed to the use of "extended structs" where it made sense to avoid
  complex arrays:
  - ezcConsoleOutputFormats (iteration and on-the-fly creation of format
  definitions in ezcConsoleOutput through  $out->formats->{formatname}->{formatoption} = ...;
- Changed handling of parameter names in ezcConsoleInput. 
  Short and long parameters are now handled both without their prefixes ("-"
  for short names and "--" for long names) everywhere.
- Changed to use overloading property access - __get(),__set(),__isset().
  To unify access to object properties and in different other places, which
  are explicitly mentioned above (see e.g. ezcConsoleTable) where possible (more 
  convenient API).
- Changed handling of default values for ezcComponentOption.
  Default values are now set, if the parameter is not submitted at all. If an
  option that expects a value is submitted without, this results in an
  exception.
- Changed handling of table structure to classes ezcConsoleTableRow and ezcConsoleTableCell. 
  These allow a new, innovative and very convenient way to create and customize console
  based tables: 
  $table[0][]; // creates a new cell 
  $table[2][]->format = 'important'; // creates a new cell and set's it's format to 'important',
  $table[2]->align = ezcConsoleTable::ALIGN_CENTER; // set's the default align
- Renamed ezcConsoleParameter to ezcConsoleInput.
  Makes more sense, since Parameter sounded like an acronym for Option. Options are now 
  handled through the ezcConsoleOption class.
- Renamed methods:
  * ezcConsoleOutput::styleText() to ezcConsoleOutput::formatText()
  * ezcConsoleInput::fromString() to ezcConsoleInput::registerOptionString()

- Fixed bug with argument handling and non-value parameters in ezcConsoleInput.
  It was not possible to sumit the name of a parameter as an agument after the
  argument seperator "-- ".
- Fixed bug with submitting multiple parameters of the same name without value
